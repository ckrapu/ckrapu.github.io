description: A wintertime climate change solution
---

**Summary: To stop climate change, just do this -  raise crops for biomass (sequestering CO2) and freeze them in huge aboveground piles during winter by running pipes through the middle. With a little insulation, they won't ever thaw out during the summer. Since thermal exchange is $$\propto r^2$$ and total heat capacity $$\propto r^3$$, a big pile can be kept frozen indefinitely with a few tricks.**

This is text from a research proposal I never completely finished. I keep thinking that I should do something with it. Since done is better than perfect, I'm putting it here. 

# Introduction

The removal large quantities of carbon (C) from Earth's atmosphere is one of
the most promising pathways to avoiding or mitigating the worst effects
of global warming or climate change. Proposed methods for doing so
include direct air capture (DAC) [^1]. 

An advantage of direct air capture is that the relevant infrastructure does
not depend strongly on climate or soil type, and is limited primarily by
manufacturing capacity and available energy. Unfortunately, it is extremely expensive with even the  [^22] running at over $200 per ton of $CO_2e$ and generally requires the construction of bespoke machinery and equipment to perform an industrial process on atmospheric gas. 

An alternative to using
engineered systems for direct air capture is to instead allow plants to
capture carbon via photosynthesis and store the vegetative biomass in a
manner that prevents reentry of captured carbon back into circulation.
Examples of biomass-centric carbon sequestration approaches include
burial in deep, anoxic water [^2], compression into polymer-lined
bricks[^3], carbon mineralization [^4], and storing salted
biomass in a moisture-controlled environment [^5].
Unfortunately, storing carbon in deep water makes it challenging to
reliably sense and monitor carbon emission rates. Carbon casting
requires wrapping in polymer sheeting as well as storage in a controlled
environment, thereby incurring substantial added costs while carbon
mineralization requires extraction of substantial mineral resources. 

In approaches listed so far, my proposal is closest to the final option listed above 
as I also seek to take advantage of ambient environmental conditions to
reduce biological activity in stored carbon, albeit making use of
temperature instead of aridity. However, the approach advocated by
Yablonovitch et al. requires the movement of very large masses of
biological matter from productive agricultural regions to highly arid
regions in which widespread cultivation is difficult without irrigation.

Given the important role of C in Earth's biosphere, it may
be desirable in the future to access large repositories of accumulated C
without causing substantial environmental damage. The aforementioned
approaches would all require reprocessing of any stored biomass to
render stored C biologically active and economically useful.

I propose an alternative approach which sites C storage squarely within
some of Earth's most productive agricultural landscapes and without any
special postharvest treatment such as drying, salting, or spraying with
antimicrobial solution. I advocate taking advantage of large thermal
gradients between summer and winter to freeze waterlogged piles of
vegetation during the winter and rely on the system's large thermal mass
to keep the biomass biologically inactive during the summer. **More
plainly, our design consists of a large pile of waterlogged biomass with
pipes placed in parallel and with regular spacing running through the
entirety of the mass. These pipes are open during winter and closed off
during warmer conditions. An extra layer of dry biomass is added
immediately before the onset of spring for added insulation. This
process is repeated annually with additional biomass harvests with few
additional constraints on the size of the design. Some important
observations about the physical aspects of this design are that (1)
thermal conductivities for waterlogged or ice-bound biomass are 10-40x
greater than for dry insulating biomass, (2) the thermal exchange area
of the design can be controlled via the installation of low-cost
interior piping, (3) the latent heat of fusion for frozen water stored
in the voids of the biomass provides large thermal inertia, and (4)
natural processes of decomposition releasing carbon from biomass are
slowed substantially at freezing temperatures and in anoxic conditions.
To further understand whether using passive cooling during wintertime is
a viable method of keeping biomass from decaying and emitting carbon, I
address three primary questions:

1.  Are estimated rates of C emission from biomass decay at near- or
    sub-freezing temperatures sufficiently low to enable carbon
    sequestration on timescales of a century or longer?

2.  What are the basic scaling relations between mass, size, and
    available thermal energy for a rudimentary storage design? 1

3.  Can the proposed approach be competitive with other approaches for
    cheaply sequestering carbon?

I conclude this proposal with a ranking of the most salient topics for
further investigation and a plan of action for rapidly executing on a
basic field trial for proof-of-concept.

## Biological viability

(TL:DR; frozen carbon doesn't decay very fast)

Establishing bounds on the rate of carbon decay and emission from the
proposed approach is challenging as most of the relevant literature on
near-freezing respiration focuses on soil with a wide variety of
microorganisms and varying proportions of inorganic material.
Furthermore, many field studies focus on *areal* rates of respiration,
summing over the entirety of the active soil column rather than
volumetric rates. Despite these differences, a basic indication of the
viability of this approach is the 1.7 billion tons of C estimated to be
stored in permafrost soils currently; [^6] provides a review of
this accounting. Laboratory experiments conducted on arctic tundra soils
obtain decay rates of 60 - 80 $$\mu$$g. C / g. C. / day at -0.5 Celsius
[^7], approximately 3 - 10% of decay rates obtained at 14 Celsius. At
even lower temperatures, [^8] estimated that carbon emission
rates of peatland soil at -14 Celsius. are approximately $$0.3 - 0.5\%$$ of
summer emission rates. The mechanisms for these emissions are not
concretely identified. Competing explanations include a purely inorganic
mechanism of freezing liquid forcing out pockets of carbon-bearing gas
[^9] as well as the creation of a transient dry front during
freezing which provides suitable conditions for respiration
[^10]. I also note existing research regarding the exhaustion of
labile carbon stocks as a limit on low-temperature microbial respiration
[^11] [^12]. The findings of this work lend weight to
the argument that laboratory experiments of carbon emissions from
low-temperature biomass will substantially overestimate long-term rates
as the former involve emissions from limited stocks of C which are
quickly exhausted on monthly to annual timescales. Many of these studies
focus on conditions favorable to aerobic respiration but the basic
design I propose in this work would yield overwhelmingly anoxic
conditions, potentially restricting respiration to be an order of
magnitude lower than in aerobic conditions [^13] [^14].
While it is clear that both low-temperature and anoxic conditions each
reduce microbial respiration rates on their own, additional review and
experimental work is needed to predict respiration rates when both
conditions apply. Another point of further analysis is the quantity of
heat generated by metabolic mechanisms;[^15] additional modeling is
needed to determine whether the heat produced by a small amount of
reaction surface is sufficient to cause melting and lead to a positive
feedback loop between biological activity and thawing.

## Thermal modeling
**Summary**: we can freeze a lot of biomass if the interior is in thermal contact with the atmosphere during wintertime


In this section, I discuss the thermal energy budget for a highly
simplified design, consisting of a biomass hemisphere of radius $$r$$
resting on level ground. I further assume that all voids have been
filled with water which has been frozen into solid ice. As a starting
point for calculations, I assume that the hemisphere is of sufficient
size to accommodate the harvest of one township (approx. 9300 hectares)
of biomass cultivation over ten seasons at a conservative yield of
approx. 3 tons per acre or 6800 kg / ha. Given these assumptions,
$$6.3 \times 10^7$$ kg of wet biomass could be harvested during that time.
Assuming that the mass of wet biomass is double that of dry biomass,
i.e. a water content of 50%, and a ratio of 1 to 1.8 for mass of dry
biomass to CO$$_{2}$$e, $5.8 \times 10^7$ kg. of CO$$_2$$e could be contained within this site.
For dry switchgrass biomass with a density of 125 kg/m$$^3$$
[^16], this would occupy $$4.6\times 10^5$$ cubic meters; this is roughly the storage volume of an average Costco store's interior.

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/assets/img/frozen-carbon-design-modified.png" alt="**Cross-sectional view of storage design**. The biomass is arranged in a hemisphere with radius r. To allow for thermal exchange during periods of low ambient temperature, conduits are placed at regular intervals of 2Î´ to increase heat transfer area." />
</div>

Suppose that we were to allow the voids of the hemisphere to be filled
with frozen water and assume 50% porosity. I take this value on the
basis of measurements reported for alfalfa bales [^17]. The
latent heat of fusion would be over $$7\times 10^{14}$$ J, more than
double the total annual solar irradiance ($$2.7\times 10^{14}$$ J) for the
area occupied by the bottom of the hemisphere. Next, we consider the
ratio $$\gamma$$ of interior thermal exchange surface area provided the by
insides of the pipes to the exterior surface area. As the interior
exchange area can be rendered largely inactive at will by plugging the
openings of the pipes and thereby preventing air flow, this ratio serves
as a measure of our ability to control thermal exchange such that there
is increased heat flow out of the system during winter and reduced heat
flow into the system during the summer. Assuming a hemispherical design
with radius $$r$$, the external area can be written as
$$a_{ext} = 3\pi r^2$$ while the total internal area of the pipe is
$$a_{pipe}=\frac{4\pi r_p r^3}{3\delta^2}$$ where $$r_p$$ denotes the pipe
radius. Then, the ratio between the two is
$$\gamma = \frac{4r_p}{9\delta^2} r$$ indicating that with a larger
storage design, our ability to control thermal fluxes in and out of the
system scales proportionally with $$r$$. To provide an example using some
rough numbers, letting $$r_p = 10$$ cm, $$r=100$$ m. and $$\delta=2$$ m.
yields $$\gamma \approx 1$$. Each pipe would correspond to roughly
$$\pi \delta^2$$ square meters of cross-sectional area. However, allowing
for larger spacing between pipes such that $$\gamma << 1$$ may be
acceptable if the insulation for the exterior surface area is
sufficiently thick.

### Internal flow rates 

With regard to thermal exchange through piping installed throughout the
mass, it is not clear under what combinations of pipe radius, pipe
length, inlet size, and wind speeds are compatible with sufficient rates
of heat exchange. As a rough estimate for flow in a pipe with Mach
number $$M \approx 10^{-2}$$, we can attempt to use Bernoulli's equation
for incompressible flow to approximate
$$\Delta p=\frac{\rho}{2}\left(v_1^2 - v_2^2\right)$$ where $$v_1, v_2$$
denote wind speeds at opposite ends of the piping and $$\Delta p$$ refers
to the difference in pressure measured at each end of the pipe due to
differences in wind speed. Then, the Hagen-Poiseuille equation predicts
volumetric flow rate of $$Q=\frac{\pi^2 r_p^4 \Delta p}{8\mu r}$$ where
$$\mu$$ is the dynamic viscosity of air and $$\rho$$ is the density of air
at 0 C. Plugging in reference values from earlier of $$r=100$$ m.,
$$r_p=10^{-1}$$ m., a difference in wind speeds of 5 meters per second,
and $$\mu=1.8 \times 10^{-5}$$ kilograms per meter-second, we arrive at a
volumetric flow rate of $$Q = 2.2$$ cubic meters per second[^18],
equivalent to a mass flow of 2.8 kg / s. Assuming operation during cold
weather in which inflowing air is 5 K cooler than air at the pipe
outlet, the heat exchanged from a single pipe in the storage mass and
dissipated into the environment would constitute an energy flux of
$$2.8 \times 5 \times 10^3$$ J/s or roughly $$1.4\times 10^4$$ watts,
providing enough exchange of thermal energy to freeze a cubic meter of
liquid water at 0C in approximately six hours. Note that the thermal
mass of the entire system is quite large; the latent heat of fusion for
the water component assuming 50% porosity calculated previously as
$$7\times 10^{14}$$ J. Assuming continuous cooling for
$$24\times 90 \times 3600$$ seconds, nearly 6000 pipes would be needed to
freeze all liquid water as desired, beginning from a completely unfrozen mass.

However, I note a few potential
ways to optimize this. First, the actual creation of the storage
mound could be done in layers during wintertime conditions, allowing for
the exterior surface area to contribute to heat dissipation as well.
Second, the mound could be constructed over multiple winters, allowing
for a much longer period of time to allow for the biomass-water mixture
to be chilled and frozen.

Further work is required to determine the ideal spacing and size of
piping to attain the right balance of thermal exchange and cost.

### External insulation 

**Summary:** Thawing becomes incredibly slow with even a modest layer of insulating plant matter

Measures to reduce the ambient environmental temperature within a buffer
area around the storage site could significantly impact the overall
thermal budget. These could include artificial insulation such as
reflective covers or shades, or plantings of vegetation with high shade
factor and/or high capacity for evapotranspiration to convert sensible
heat into latent heat. The reference design presented so far is
sufficiently tall ($$\approx 100$$ m.) to render many of these expedients
ineffective at shading the majority of the mass. A more economical
choice may be to place a layer of dry vegetative matter on top of the
design. R-values per inch for straw bales ranging from 0.5 to
2.5 have been reported [^19] and it is likely that lightly
packed, dry biomass would likely have similar insulating ability.
Placing such a layer with thickness in excess of two meters would imply
$$R \approx 80$$. From another perspective, the thermal conductivity of
straw bales has been reported at roughly $$5\times 10^{-2}$$ watts per
meter-degree [^20] while the same quantity for pure ice taken at
the freezing point of water is nearly 45 times greater at $$2.2$$ W / m-K
[^21]. These statistics imply that thermal exchange through the
exterior of the storage design would be substantially lower than through
interior cooling conduits; the former consists of a modest amount of dry
biomass layered on top while the interior is intended to be an
ice-biomass mixture. However, layering dry matter on top does not come
entirely without drawback; any biomass which is not frozen solid and
exposed to the elements is likely to degrade more rapidly than similar
mass contained deeper within the storage design. Determining an optimal
insulating layer thickness and interior conduit spacing requires further
investigation. Furthermore, it is unclear how much the value of this
insulation would be reduced by precipitation falling onto the biomass.
Given sufficient available water resources, one option for increasing
the heat capacity of the storage design is to fill all voids in the
biomass with water which may then freeze if exposed to cold weather.
However, this reduces the naturally high insulative value of candidate
biomass materials like switchgrass and miscanthus. It is likely that
there exists some optimal strategy for partially filling the voids of
the interior of the storage design while letting the outermost portions
remain dry to provide insulation. Further work would be needed identify
this optimum.

### Economic viability

Showing feasibility for the proposed C storage design requires
accounting for a variety of fixed and marginal costs. In this section,
I reproduce several important numbers from [^5], making
use of their extensive economic analyses as a starting point for our
own. As I similarly make use of agricultural biomass, I quote their
numbers for cost per ton of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO$$_2$$e) in USD of \$6, \$13, and \$10 for
land purchase, crop establishment, and post-establishment cultivation
respectively for sequestered miscanthus. However, the design proposed in
that work requires dry storage, application of electric dryers, and rain
water protection which are unnecessary for our design, though we do also
require operations with heavy equipment for stacking and placement of
biomass as well as possible compression, yielding per-ton costs of
\$$$8.80$$ under the assumptions of Yablonovitch et al. We also avoid most
capital expenditures associated with the biolandfill design since no
provision must be made for moisture management or geotechnical
engineering. Altogether, the design elements which we share in common
with that work constitute a per-CO$$_2$$e ton cost of approximately \$38.
This number omits (1) the cost of piping to allow for heat transfer, and
(2) annual spring and fall adjustment of the pipe openings to allow or
block heat exchange. For (1), I note that each linear meter of piping
corresponds to $$\pi\delta^2 \approx 12.5$$ cubic meters of stored
biomass; at a dry density of 160 kg / m$$^3$$, this implies a cost in
piping material of \$7.00 per ton CO$$_2$$e if using bulk polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) pipe with $$r_p=0.1$$ m. priced at \$10.00 per meter. I
anticipate negligible costs associated with manually sealing off or
opening off the piping on a biannual basis. I also do not consider the
net carbon emissions from manufacturing PVC piping. In total, I
anticipate a total cost of USD \$ 45 / ton CO$$_2$$e. At this price, As a
final note, calculations associated with the simplified hemispherical
design previously illustrated remain valid for arbitrarily large storage
volumes. However, instead of increasing the radius of the hemisphere, it
may be more expedient to extend the design along a horizontal axis to
produce an oval-shaped or cylindrical repository.

In a previous section, I provided a rough number of 6800 kg. biomass harvested per hectare each year. To entirely offset global emissions of carbon dioxide, we would need approximately 40 billion tons sequestered per year; at 6 metric tons per acre, this implies 6 billion hectares of arable land. Unfortunately, we only have 1.4 billion hectares.

## Next steps?

To see if this works, I
propose some or any of the following

1.  An experiment under controlled laboratory conditions measuring the
    metabolic activity of waterlogged biomass from several species
    including switchgrass and miscanthus, conducted over a range of
    temperatures, water content values, and vegetation fragment sizes.\

2.  A field trial using similar vegetative material at a relatively
    small scale ($$r \approx 10$$m.) with installed piping to verify key
    assumptions regarding insulation, heat capacity, and thaw rate

3.  Numerical simulations for calculating likely thermal exchange rates
    through different piping arrangements and densities

4.  Numerical simulations for a simplified system using representative
    forcing data for air temperature, incident solar radiation, and
    windspeed over 10+ years
