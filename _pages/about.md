Currently working on internal AI tools @ NVIDIA. 

I received my graduate training in statistics and civil engineering at Duke University under Mark Borsuk, graduating in 2020. I was awarded full-funding fellowships by NASA ([NESSF, 2017](https://cce.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/terrestrial_ecology/pi_list.pl?projType=project&progID=2&projID=4037)) and the NSF ([IGERT, 2014](https://czo-archive.criticalzone.org/calhoun/news/story/duke-phd-students-win-2-year-igert-fellowships/)) with ancillary support from Amazon and NVIDIA. My research focused on developing graphical models for high-dimensional environmental data, with applications in engineering and spatial statistics.
